# A-MACHINE-LEARNING-APPROACH-FOR-AUTOMATIC-GRADING-OF-STUDENT-EXAM-PAPERS

This repository contains the implementation of a Machine Learning Approach for Automatic Grading of Student Exam Papers, designed to streamline the evaluation process for educators while ensuring consistency and accuracy in grading.

Features
Automated Grading: Leverages machine learning techniques to evaluate and grade student responses.
Support for Subjective and Objective Questions: Handles both multiple-choice (objective) and descriptive (subjective) answers.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyzes and evaluates free-text responses using NLP models.
Customizable Rubrics: Allows educators to define grading criteria and weightage for each question.
Scalable Design: Capable of grading large volumes of student responses efficiently.
Performance Metrics: Provides accuracy and consistency comparisons against manual grading.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
Natural Language Processing: spaCy, NLTK, or Hugging Face Transformers
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Web Framework (Optional): Flask/Django for creating a user interface for educators.
